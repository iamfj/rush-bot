# Rush Trading Bot

Rush is designed for the end-user, for you, the trader, who wants to quickly 
implement his strategy in a bot. Rush offers a solution with a focus on 
simplicity, strategy implementation and backtesting. 

The open source approach is important for rush to make rapid progress in 
mapping a wide range of exchanges and indicators. The forum serves as an 
place for all users and developers to share and discuss ideas, strategies 
and progress. Rush lives through a community that uses and develops the bot.
